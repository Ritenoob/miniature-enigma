Build an optimizer that explores:
- indicator parameters (RSI, W%R, MACD, AO, EMA, Bollinger, Stochastic, plus KDJ, OBV, ADX if enabled)
- combinations (templates) and weights/profiles/thresholds
- dual timeframe (entry TF + filter TF) and refine timeframes via optimization

Search:
Stage A: large random/LHS screening, parallel worker_threads
Stage B: refinement (NSGA-II or TPE Bayesian) multi-objective
Include ablation:
- remove each indicator from the winning config and measure delta

Important:
- DOM logic is excluded from offline optimization (no historical DOM).
- Mark configs as “DOM-ready” only for forward-shadow evaluation.

Outputs:
- Top 20 ranked configs
- Pareto front JSON
- configs saved as versioned JSON in research/configs/
- CSV leaderboard with all key metrics and fold stability
