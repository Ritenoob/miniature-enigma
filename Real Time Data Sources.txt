Real-Time Data Sources for a Dual-Timeframe Crypto Screener
Exchange Native APIs (KuCoin & Binance)
KuCoin Exchange API (Futures) – KuCoin’s native API provides real-time data for all KuCoin Futures (perpetual) contracts. It offers both REST and WebSocket endpoints. Key points include:
OHLCV & Endpoints: KuCoin’s REST endpoint for candlesticks is GET /api/v1/kline/query on the futures API
kucoin.com
. This returns up to 500 data points per call (with parameters for symbol, interval, start/end time)
kucoin.com
kucoin.com
. WebSocket channels are also available (e.g. topic /market/candles:{symbol}_{interval}) for live candle updates
kucoin.com
, which can push new 1m/5m/etc. bars in real-time. Ticker and order book feeds are similarly accessible via WebSocket.
Rate Limits: KuCoin’s API permits high-frequency calls. The public futures data pool allows up to 4,000 requests per 30 seconds for a regular user (VIP0)
kucoin.com
. Each OHLCV query has a weight of 3
kucoin.com
, meaning in theory you could do over 1,300 kline requests in 30s without hitting the limit. In practice, scanning 40 symbols per minute (every 1.5s on average) is well within KuCoin’s limits. WebSocket usage is unlimited aside from connection counts (which are generous, e.g. up to 500 simultaneous subscriptions)
kucoin.com
.
Symbol Support: Being the exchange’s API, it supports all KuCoin futures pairs (e.g. ETHUSDTM, BTCUSDTM for perpetuals). No conversion or mapping is needed – you use KuCoin’s exact symbol codes. This source exclusively covers KuCoin (it won’t provide Binance data).
Data Latency: Real-time. You get exchange-direct data with no aggregation delay. WebSocket data is essentially instant (<1s latency), and REST polling can easily achieve sub-1s to a few seconds latency depending on your interval. There’s no artificial delay on quotes or candles.
Free Access: KuCoin’s market data API is free to use. No paid plan is required for standard rate limits. With an API key (even a free account) you get the full rate quota; public (no-key) access is also possible with slightly lower limits (2,000/30s in the public pool)
kucoin.com
. In short, KuCoin’s own API can handle a high-frequency screener at no cost.
Integration: KuCoin provides official Node.js SDKs and the API is standard JSON over HTTPS, making integration straightforward. For high-frequency scanning, the WebSocket approach is recommended (subscribe once to the needed symbols’ candlestick or ticker feeds and receive continuous updates, rather than polling repeatedly). This minimizes both latency and load.
Binance API (Binance Futures) – Binance’s API is similarly robust for real-time futures data on all major contracts. Notable features:
OHLCV & Endpoints: Binance Futures REST has GET /fapi/v1/klines for candlesticks
developers.binance.com
. This returns up to 1500 candles (default 500) for a given symbol & interval
developers.binance.com
. Binance also offers multi-symbol ticker endpoints: e.g. GET /fapi/v1/ticker/24hr can return 24h stats for all futures symbols in one call (useful for snapshot scanning), and GET /fapi/v1/ticker/price for all last prices. WebSockets are a strong point: you can subscribe to individual symbol streams (e.g. <symbol>@kline_5m) or use Binance’s combined streams to receive multiple symbols’ data on one connection. Binance even provides a “!miniTicker@arr” stream which pushes real-time price updates for every symbol in an array.
Rate Limits: Binance uses a weight-based system. A single kline REST request with a modest limit (<=100 candles) counts as weight=1
developers.binance.com
. The system allows up to 1,200 weight units per minute on most public endpoints (no API key required), which translates to roughly 1,200 calls/minute in this case. Scanning ~40 symbol-timeframes per minute (40 weight) is trivial relative to this limit. Batch endpoints (like the all-symbol ticker) have higher weight (e.g. the all-symbol 24hr ticker = weight 40), but give you data for dozens of pairs at once. WebSocket connections are limited in number (<= 300 inbound connection attempts per 5 min, and 5 incoming messages/sec per connection)
developers.binance.com
developers.binance.com
, but a single connection can carry many streams, and 20–30 symbols is easily handled on one socket.
Symbol Support: The Binance API covers all Binance USDⓈ-M perpetual futures pairs (and coin-margined futures with a different endpoint). You use Binance’s symbol codes (e.g. BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT). This won’t give KuCoin data, of course, but Binance’s futures universe (and liquidity) is large if you want to include those markets.
Data Latency: Real-time. Direct from Binance exchange – updates are extremely fast. WebSocket kline streams provide each trade update and mark candle closes in real-time, typically well under a second latency. REST data is as fresh as the moment you query (no added delay).
Free Access: Binance’s API is free. No subscription needed for full market data. Even without an API key, you get the standard rate limits. (If you create an API key, limits remain the same for public endpoints, but you might prefer a key for organized tracking.) There are no tiers or paywalls for market data on Binance.
Integration: Binance has widely-used Node.js libraries (like binance-api-node or CCXT) and detailed docs. You can poll REST endpoints on a 30s schedule, but a better approach is to use WebSocket streams for continuous data. For example, subscribe to all desired symbols’ 5m and 15m candlesticks; Binance will push updates, and your Node.js bot can maintain an in-memory buffer of the latest OHLCV for each timeframe. This reduces the need for constant HTTP requests and ensures sub-second reactivity.
Comparison (KuCoin vs Binance): Both exchange APIs offer real-time, granular data with generous free limits, suitable for a screener. Binance has an edge in allowing a single call for multiple tickers (and an all-symbol websocket stream), whereas KuCoin’s API is per-symbol for candles (you’d open one WS topic per symbol or do rapid sequential calls). If your screener must cover both KuCoin and Binance markets, you might end up integrating both APIs separately (each covers only its own exchange). In exchange for that complexity, you get the most up-to-date data straight from the source.
Aggregated Data APIs (Multi-Exchange Sources)
CoinGecko API – CoinGecko provides a free, aggregation-focused API covering thousands of crypto assets across many exchanges. It’s useful for general market data but has drawbacks for high-frequency signals:
Data & Endpoints: CoinGecko’s API is REST-only (no WebSockets)
medium.com
. It offers endpoints like /simple/price for quick price retrieval (multiple coins in one call), and /coins/{id}/ohlc for OHLC data
docs.coingecko.com
docs.coingecko.com
. However, the OHLC endpoint is primarily for charting and has automatic interval selection (e.g. if you request < 2 days of data it gives 30-minute candles)
docs.coingecko.com
. You cannot directly query 1m or 5m candles for arbitrary ranges via free API – it’s more for coarse historical charts. There is no concept of specific exchange pairs in most endpoints (prices are aggregated or averaged). CoinGecko does list exchange tickers (via /coins/{id}/tickers or /exchanges endpoints), but these are more for listing markets than for rapid data pulls. Bottom line: CoinGecko excels at broad market snapshots (prices, market cap, etc.) but not at delivering exchange-specific live OHLCV streams.
Rate Limits: The free CoinGecko API is quite generous in call volume. Officially, it’s “up to ~10-30 calls per minute” on the free tier, dynamically adjusted by their systems
medium.com
. In practice many users see ~50-100/minute capacity
mixedanalytics.com
. There’s no hard API key requirement for free use (they now offer an optional “demo” key). So hitting 20-40 calls every minute is possible on free. The issue is not the call count limit so much as data freshness.
Data Latency: Not truly real-time. Free CoinGecko data is cached and updated on a cycle – typically every 1 to 5 minutes for price endpoints
medium.com
, and OHLC endpoints are updated every 15 minutes
docs.coingecko.com
. For example, the /simple/price might lag a minute behind the exchange, and the OHLC feed will certainly be delayed (it’s not streaming new candle closes instantly). CoinGecko explicitly notes that even paid plans only get up to 30s update frequency on prices
medium.com
. This falls short of the “<30s latency” requirement for a live screener.
Exchange/Futures Support: CoinGecko’s data is generally aggregated by coin. It does track derivatives markets (futures) in its database, but accessing specific futures prices via API is not straightforward. There are endpoints for derivatives (e.g. /derivatives/exchanges and /derivatives listings), which provide information like contract name, index price, open interest, etc., but these are not real-time price feeds. There isn’t a simple REST call to get “the current 5m OHLC for ETH-PERP on KuCoin” from CoinGecko. You could get ETH’s USD price generally, but not the exact contract’s orderbook data in real-time. In short, KuCoin futures pairs are not first-class citizens in the CoinGecko API for rapid querying.
Free Tier & Usage: The API is free for almost all data (with no key, or a free key). No limits on which endpoints you can use, aside from rate throttling. The free tier is sufficient for development, but again, the data update frequency is the bottleneck. CoinGecko Pro plans (starting around $100+/mo) increase the update frequency to ~30s and allow 500-1000 calls/minute
medium.com
, but if considering paid options, other providers might serve better for our use-case.
Use Case Fit: For a low-frequency scanner or a research dashboard, CoinGecko’s free API is fantastic (broad coverage, no cost). But for a high-frequency screener (20+ symbols every 30s) focusing on specific exchange futures, it’s not ideal. You’d risk stale data and it doesn’t natively support multi-timeframe OHLC querying per exchange.
CoinMarketCap API – CoinMarketCap offers a professional market data API with wide asset coverage, but the free tier is very limited for our needs:
Data & Endpoints: CMC’s API provides endpoints for latest quotes, OHLCV, historical data, exchange info, etc. However, the free Basic plan only includes 9 endpoints (primarily current market data and metadata)
algotrading101.com
. Crucially, intraday OHLCV and historical endpoints are not available on the free tier
algotrading101.com
medium.com
. A free user can query “latest quotes” (prices) for coins, including multiple symbols in one call (e.g. up to 100 symbols per /v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest request by specifying a comma-separated list). But you won’t get candlestick data without paying for at least the Startup plan.
Rate Limits: Free tier is 10,000 calls per month, which is about 333 calls/day
medium.com
. That averages to just 13-14 calls per hour – far below the ~60+ calls/hour a 30-second scanner would need. Even the $79/mo Startup plan gives ~50k calls/month (~1,666/day)
medium.com
, still only ~69 calls/hour. Higher tiers raise this substantially, but costs escalate (Standard $199/mo, etc., reaching millions of calls for enterprise)
medium.com
medium.com
. The free tier also updates data roughly every 1-2 minutes on CMC’s side for prices
medium.com
, since it’s not a streaming service.
Exchange/Futures Support: CMC does catalog derivatives markets and could provide data on futures prices/volume if you have a high-tier plan. For instance, they have endpoints for exchange market pairs and can return data for a specific trading pair on a given exchange (including futures). But on the free/basic plan, you’re essentially limited to aggregated data (global prices for a coin). So accessing KuCoin futures specifically via the free API isn’t feasible. On paid tiers, one could query something like the “market pairs” endpoint to get KuCoin’s ETH-PERP price, but by the time you pay for that, a direct exchange API would have given it to you faster and for free.
Data Latency: Moderate. CMC is not real-time for free users. Even on higher plans, their data is refreshed periodically (each coin’s quote updated ~every minute). They currently don’t offer true websocket streaming (though it’s mentioned as a future feature)
pro.coinmarketcap.com
. For <30s reaction times, CMC’s model isn’t suitable.
Free Tier Usage: In summary, CMC’s free tier is too restrictive for a live screener – insufficient call volume and missing the OHLC endpoints. It’s aimed at basic apps that just need infrequent price updates on a few coins
medium.com
. To use CMC for this use-case, a paid plan would be required, but this would mainly buy you data that is available elsewhere for less cost or free (since you specifically need frequent, low-latency updates, which CMC specializes less in).
Recommendation: Unless you already have a CMC subscription, this is not the best choice for a high-frequency screening engine. The value of CMC’s API is in breadth and reliability for enterprise, but for a nimble real-time scanner, other solutions (or exchange APIs) provide more bang for buck.
CryptoCompare API – CryptoCompare is a third-party that offers full-market coverage and has options for real-time data, including both REST and WebSocket. It aggregates data from many exchanges yet can also return exchange-specific info. Important points:
Coverage & Data: CryptoCompare tracks 5,700+ coins and 260,000+ trading pairs across 170+ exchanges
medium.com
. This includes KuCoin, Binance, and most major platforms. The API provides current price quotes, live tick data, order books, and OHLCV candlesticks at various timeframes
medium.com
medium.com
. You can get aggregate market prices (their “CCCAGG” indices) or specify a particular exchange. For example, you can call:
https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/histominute?fsym=ETH&tsym=USDT&e=KuCoin&limit=5
to get minute candles for ETH/USDT on KuCoin. Or use the multi-symbol price endpoint to fetch many coins’ latest prices in one shot (e.g. /pricemultifull?fsyms=BTC,ETH,SOL&tsyms=USDT). CryptoCompare also offers a streaming WebSocket where you can subscribe to tick updates or candlestick formations for multiple pairs at once. Essentially, it can function as a one-stop feed for all the symbols in your screener, across exchanges
medium.com
.
Rate Limits (Free vs Paid): CryptoCompare’s legacy free API (no key) allowed a generous amount of data, but as of now you need an API key (they have a free key option). They don’t publish exact free limits, but users report the free tier allows on the order of a few thousand calls per day
medium.com
. Mixed Analytics notes 100,000 calls/month (≈3,300/day) as a threshold before needing to pay
mixedanalytics.com
. This is far better than CMC’s free allocation, but still may not cover ~50k+ calls/day (which a strict 30s polling of 40 items would generate). However, CryptoCompare’s advantage is that you can reduce calls by leveraging their multi-symbol endpoints or WebSocket: for instance, one WebSocket connection with 20 subscriptions would push all needed updates continuously, essentially bypassing REST call limits. Paid plans start around ~$80/month for ~100k calls/month and higher data resolution
medium.com
, and ~$200/month for a few hundred thousand calls plus extended history
medium.com
. Enterprise plans can go into millions of calls and provide even more data (like full tick history)
medium.com
. In summary: The free tier might suffice if you design efficiently (and perhaps only run the screener during certain hours), but many serious use-cases will bump into the limits and require at least the first paid tier.
Data Latency: Near real-time. CryptoCompare aggregates exchange feeds with very low lag. They claim infrastructure supporting 40,000 calls per second and high trade throughput
medium.com
, meaning their servers can handle real-time data distribution. When you query a price or subscribe to a ticker, you’re essentially getting data that’s only milliseconds behind the exchange. One consideration: if you use their aggregated index price (CCCAGG), that price is computed from many markets and updated as new trades arrive – it’s real-time, but it’s an average price. If you specifically request data from one exchange (using the e= parameter), you get that exchange’s feed directly. CryptoCompare’s WebSocket delivers tick-by-tick updates for trades and can even form candles in real-time. This meets the <30s latency requirement easily (latency is typically ~1-2s or better, largely network-dependent).
Symbol/Exchange Support: KuCoin Futures – Yes. CryptoCompare lists KuCoin and its markets. For futures, you need to ensure you use the correct symbol. (E.g., KuCoin’s ETH perpetual might be identified as “ETHUSDT” on CryptoCompare with exchange=KuCoin, if they treat the perp the same as the spot pair. CryptoCompare’s documentation would clarify symbol nomenclature for futures markets – sometimes they append “Futures” to the exchange name or have a specific designation for perpetuals). In general, CryptoCompare covers perpetual swaps from many exchanges (including Binance’s and others as well) in their dataset. You can query by the exchange name and trading pair. This fulfills the requirement of covering at least KuCoin and ideally Binance: you can hit one API and get both exchanges’ data.
Free Tier Usage: CryptoCompare’s free plan is suitable for initial development and low-frequency monitoring. For instance, if you only query every minute and use one call to get multiple symbols, you might stay under a few thousand calls/day. They also often don’t enforce small overages strictly for personal keys. But if you try to aggressively poll 20+ markets every 30s, you will likely need to optimize or upgrade. One optimization is using their WebSocket so that you register 20 subscriptions and then just listen (0 REST calls/min). If a Node.js engine can manage a socket feed, this is ideal. Otherwise, you could batch requests (e.g. 5 calls fetching 4 symbols each per minute) to reduce overhead.
Integration: CryptoCompare provides data in JSON; it’s not as plug-and-play as an exchange SDK, but it’s a simple HTTP GET or a socket connection. There are community libraries for CryptoCompare, or you can use a generic WebSocket client. One thing to note is that CryptoCompare returns data in slightly different format than exchange APIs (for example, field names like open, high, low, close, volumeto etc.). Minor adjustments will be needed in your parser. Overall, integration is feasible in Node.js – and it has the benefit of consolidating multiple exchanges’ data into one code path.
Twelve Data API – Twelve Data is a financial data provider that covers stocks, forex, and crypto. It has a unified API for many assets. For crypto, Twelve Data can be used but there are limitations:
Data & Endpoints: Twelve Data offers a /time_series endpoint that returns OHLCV data for a given symbol and interval (e.g. 5m, 15m). You can request JSON or CSV output. Crucially, Twelve Data supports batch queries: you can specify multiple symbols in one request (comma-separated in the symbol parameter) to fetch the same interval data for several assets at once
support.twelvedata.com
. For example, GET /time_series?symbol=BTC/USD,ETH/USD&interval=5min&outputsize=1 could fetch the latest 5-minute candle for BTC and ETH in one call. They also have /quote and /price endpoints for real-time quotes, and even technical indicators on demand. This batching is useful to reduce call count – however, note that each symbol still consumes one credit in your usage quota
support.twelvedata.com
. Twelve Data does provide a WebSocket for streaming prices as well (with certain plans)
support.twelvedata.com
.
Rate Limits: The free Basic plan is 8 API credits per minute, 800 per day
support.twelvedata.com
. This is very low for our needs – essentially, one could fetch data for at most 8 symbols per minute (if each symbol = 1 credit). Even using batch, you could put all 20 symbols in one request, but that would consume 20 credits in that single call, far exceeding the 8/minute limit (the system would likely reject or only return partial data)
support.twelvedata.com
support.twelvedata.com
. So the free tier cannot support scanning 20+ markets every 30-60s. Paid tiers (“Grow” ~$79/mo, “Pro” ~$229/mo, etc.) increase the per-minute cap significantly (e.g. Grow = 54/min, Pro = 164/min)
hexdocs.pm
 and remove daily caps, which would accommodate our use-case. But at that point, one must consider cost vs benefit.
Exchange/Futures Support: Twelve Data’s crypto data is somewhat abstracted. Symbols are given as {BASE}/{QUOTE} (e.g. ETH/USDT), and you can specify an exchange parameter if you want a specific exchange’s pricing
support.twelvedata.com
support.twelvedata.com
. In practice, Twelve Data covers many exchanges, but it’s oriented more toward spot markets. For example, BTC/USD on Coinbase vs Binance can be specified. For KuCoin, if they support it, you’d set symbol=ETH/USDT&exchange=KuCoin. The question is whether this pulls the spot ETH/USDT price on KuCoin or the perpetual futures price – Twelve Data’s documentation does not explicitly differentiate futures. They list “available_exchanges” for each symbol; for some crypto pairs, they include a set of exchanges where that pair trades
support.twelvedata.com
. KuCoin appears in their lists, but likely referring to spot. They might not list perpetual swaps separately. It’s possible that for major perpetuals (BTC, ETH), they use the futures price if you specify e.g. exchange=“Binance Futures”, but this is not clearly documented. Thus, there’s uncertainty if Twelve Data can retrieve KuCoin futures specifically. It may instead give you the spot market data for KuCoin. This is a key consideration – using spot data when you need futures could be a fatal flaw for a strategy screener.
Data Latency: Twelve Data’s slogan is real-time data, and indeed for paid users their websocket and API provide low-latency updates. The REST API will give you the latest available data on request (no intentional delay). The timeliness ultimately depends on how fast they ingest from exchanges. Typically, their data is reasonably up-to-date (within seconds of exchange). However, on the free plan, since you’re so throttled, you can’t really get frequent updates anyway. With a paid plan and streaming, you could achieve sub-30s latency easily.
Free vs Paid: Free tier is not sufficient for this use. It’s fine for testing or getting daily data, but not for a live multi-symbol scanner. If one were to pay, the Basic paid tier ($79) would allow 54 requests/minute
hexdocs.pm
, which could cover 20 symbols every 30s (40 requests/min). You could even batch 5-10 symbols per call to improve efficiency. So technically a paid Twelve Data plan could work. But one must weigh that cost against simply using free exchange APIs.
Integration: Twelve Data has a unified format (which is nice if you also care about stocks or other assets in the same project). They have SDKs and also a simple HTTP interface. Batch querying means you get a JSON response with multiple series. It’s a bit more complex to parse but saves overhead. If your bot is Node.js, you can easily call their REST or open a websocket for streaming quotes. One potential benefit is simplicity: one service, one API key, covering multiple types of assets. The drawback is the cost and possible lack of specific futures support.
TradingView Chart API – It’s worth mentioning that TradingView does not offer a public data API for market data
tradingview.com
. The “TradingView chart API” often refers to their Charting Library widget, which allows you to feed your own data into a TradingView UI. But you cannot pull TradingView’s proprietary data via an official REST or WebSocket API. (They have a private feed for their charts and a brokerage integration API, but not a general data export API.) In short, TradingView is not a viable data source for programmatically scanning crypto prices – any usage of TradingView data would violate their terms or require scraping their site, which is not recommended. So we can rule this out as an option
tradingview.com
.
Best Choice & Recommendation
For a high-frequency dual-timeframe screener monitoring 20+ perpetual futures, the exchange-native APIs combined with WebSockets emerge as the best solution:
Use Direct Exchange Feeds for Real-Time Needs: The most reliable and low-latency approach is to connect directly to the exchanges where these futures trade (e.g. KuCoin and Binance). Both KuCoin and Binance offer free, high-capacity APIs that easily handle a scan every 30 seconds (or even every 1 second). By leveraging WebSockets, you can get continuous updates without polling overhead. For example, subscribe to the 5m and 15m candlestick streams for all 20 symbols on KuCoin’s and Binance’s sockets. Your Node.js bot can accumulate the latest candles and compute scores in real time. This way, data is push-based and nearly instantaneous. Latency will be on the order of 1-2 seconds or less, far exceeding the <30s requirement.
Multi-Exchange Coverage: If your screener must cover multiple exchanges simultaneously, you might run separate modules for each (one for KuCoin, one for Binance). This is a bit more integration work, but ensures you get each exchange’s exact data. You can then combine the results in your scoring logic. Since both APIs are free, this approach is cost-effective. The main “cost” is development time to handle two APIs, but libraries like CCXT could unify some access if needed (CCXT can fetch OHLCV from many exchanges, though for real-time websockets you’d still handle each exchange’s socket).
When to Consider Aggregators: If maintaining multiple exchange connections is too complex or if you want a single unified API to simplify development, CryptoCompare is likely the best third-party option. It covers both KuCoin and Binance futures, and with a single WebSocket connection to CryptoCompare’s aggregated feed, you could subscribe to all 20+ markets and get real-time ticks/candles across exchanges in one stream. This dramatically simplifies the screener’s data ingestion. However, the free tier of CryptoCompare may not reliably sustain the needed throughput
medium.com
. For serious use, you’d budget for at least their basic paid plan (or find out if the personal/free key can handle continuous socket streaming of 20 markets – it might, if it’s just streaming data which is typically unlimited). CryptoCompare’s data might introduce slight delays (maybe on the order of seconds) due to aggregation and network hops, but it’s generally fast and certainly within 30s.
Avoiding Rate Limit Issues: CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, while great for many purposes, are not suited for rapid-fire screening. CoinGecko’s data update interval (1-5 minutes on free) is too slow
medium.com
, and CoinMarketCap’s free allowance (333 calls/day) is too low
medium.com
. They would either deliver stale signals or throttle your requests. Twelve Data can work if you pay, but at that point its benefits are comparable to CryptoCompare or even a direct exchange feed (and we still have uncertainty about futures pair support on Twelve Data). TradingView is a non-starter for data access
tradingview.com
.
Hybrid Approach: You might consider a hybrid: for example, use an aggregator’s single call to get a quick snapshot of all symbols to decide which ones need deeper analysis, then query exchange APIs for detailed OHLC data of those. But given our scenario (20+ fixed symbols every interval), a hybrid isn’t necessary – you know which symbols you care about upfront. A hybrid could make sense if the universe was larger (say 100 symbols) and you wanted to filter down to 20 using an initial screening (in that case, one CoinGecko call for 100 prices could flag top movers, then you pull OHLC from exchanges for those top 20).
Node.js Integration: Both KuCoin and Binance have well-documented WebSocket APIs that can be used with Node’s ws library (or their official SDKs). CryptoCompare also has a WebSocket endpoint (documentation provided on their site) and even a Node package for it. Implementing the screener in Node is feasible with any of these; it’s more a question of data quality and timeliness. Exchange APIs give you raw, direct data (optimal for trading signals). An aggregator gives convenience and breadth but might introduce slight latency or require a subscription for full performance.
Recommendation: Given the priorities (real-time data, at least KuCoin support, free or low-cost), the best route is to use the native exchange APIs – specifically, KuCoin’s WebSocket for KuCoin futures and Binance’s API/WebSocket for any Binance markets. This ensures you have fresh OHLCV data within seconds of each candle close and even intra-candle if needed. Both are free and handle the scale of 20+ symbols easily
kucoin.com
developers.binance.com
. If a single unified data source is absolutely desired, CryptoCompare would be the next best, as it covers all required exchanges and timeframes with one API (with a potential cost if you need extensive usage)
medium.com
. In summary, for a live crypto screener scanning dozens of perpetuals every 30-60s, using exchange-provided data streams is optimal. You might start with KuCoin’s native feed (since KuCoin is a must-have) and add Binance’s feed for more markets. This combination yields real-time precision and avoids third-party limitations. Only consider third-party APIs if maintaining multiple exchange connections becomes too cumbersome – and among those, favor the ones like CryptoCompare that are built for real-time and multi-exchange support rather than general info aggregators.
