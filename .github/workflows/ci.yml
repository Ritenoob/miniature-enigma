# CI Workflow for KuCoin Futures Dashboard
#
# This workflow runs tests on every push and pull request to ensure code quality.
# It works independently of the security scanning workflows.
#
# Security Scanning Note:
# - This repository uses CodeQL Advanced setup (see .github/workflows/codeql.yml)
# - GitHub's default CodeQL setup must be DISABLED for advanced workflow to work
# - See README.md "Security Scanning Setup" section for configuration instructions
# - For troubleshooting, see docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
