Extend the existing scoring system without changing its structure.

Current indicators in SignalGenerator-configurable.js:
- RSI, Williams %R, MACD, AO, EMA trend, Stochastic, Bollinger
(signal-weights.js contains configs for those)

You must add:
1) KDJ (K, D, J)
2) OBV (with optional EMA smoothing and slope confirmation)
3) DOM (orderbook imbalance/spread) — LIVE VALIDATION ONLY
4) (Optional but recommended) ADX + DI+/DI- as regime filter and trend strength score

Required changes:
- Update signal-weights.js schema:
  - add kdj, obv, dom, adx sections in weights and in each profile
  - maintain activeProfile mechanism and thresholds object
- Update SignalGenerator-configurable.js:
  - compute contributions and push breakdown entries with:
    indicator, value, contribution, reason, type
  - keep output format: { type, score, confidence, breakdown, profile }
  - confidence must remain derived from |score| mapping

Scoring rules (sane defaults; optimizer will tune them):
- KDJ:
  - bullish if J extremely low + turns upward OR K crosses above D in oversold zone
  - bearish mirrored
- OBV:
  - bullish if slope(OBV, window) positive beyond threshold (or zscore) with optional EMA smoothing
  - bearish mirrored
- DOM:
  - compute imbalance at depths 5/10/25 and spread
  - DOM must be behind DOM_ENABLED flag
  - any DOM contribution must be tagged in breakdown as “LIVE_ONLY_VALIDATION_REQUIRED”
  - offline backtests may NOT use DOM; only forward-shadow can evaluate DOM gates

Do not break adjust-weights.js compatibility. If needed, extend it to support new keys safely.
Deliver unit tests for each new indicator scoring contribution.
