Create a deterministic backtester that reuses the SAME SignalGenerator-configurable.js and signal-weights.js as live.

Backtester must simulate:
- Fees (maker/taker) and slippage (multiple models)
- Fill model toggle:
  - taker fill
  - probabilistic_limit (proxy for 9th-level entry) using:
    offset model + max time-to-fill + volatility/spread proxy
- ROI-based SL/TP leverage-aware
- aggressive stop-tightening preference:
  - implement as stop-tightening rules (not forced exit)
- fee-aware break-even supported
- staircase trailing stop and scale/lock profit
- reduceOnly exits
- multi-symbol concurrency and max positions (configurable)

Evaluation:
- Walk-forward with purge
- Regime tagging:
  - volatility buckets via ATR%
  - trending vs ranging via ADX if enabled
- Metrics:
  - net return, PF, expectancy (R), max DD, tail loss, stability score, worst fold
- Enforce minimum trades per fold internally to avoid false winners

Outputs:
- trade log CSV
- run summary JSON
- fold/regime breakdown CSV
- reproducible seed support
