Generate the full Optimization & Experimentation System described in Prompts 0–5, integrated into the existing kucoin-analysis-dashboard-main repo without breaking server.js runtime.

Deliver:
1) Complete file tree
2) All code (TS preferred, but incremental: keep server.js operational)
3) Tests (Jest + fast-check)
4) README with commands:
   - fetch data
   - run backtests
   - run optimization
   - run live forward shadow tests
   - export top configs
5) Sample configs:
   - aggressive (tight SL, fast lock)
   - conservative (lower DD)
   - trend-focused
   - mean-reversion-focused
6) Default settings reflecting Mirko’s preferences:
   - dynamic sizing by signal strength + volatility
   - auto leverage (ATR% tiering) with manual override
   - early stop tightening preference (small loss > larger loss), implemented as stop tightening logic, not forced exit
   - MTF optional toggle; optimizer searches MTF pairs

Hard requirements:
- Reproducibility (seeded)
- Walk-forward with purge
- Multi-objective ranking + Pareto
- DOM features validated live only, not claimed from historical backtests
